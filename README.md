# Project description
#

This project implements a Task class that represents a task with a description and priority. The TaskManager class manages a collection of tasks and provides functionality to add, remove, show, save, and load tasks. The tasks are stored using pickle module for serialization.

The main function presents a menu to the user, allowing them to interact with the task manager. The user can add tasks, remove tasks by index, show all tasks, save tasks to a file, and load tasks from a file. Choosing the "Exit" option terminates the program.
